# Cost of Living Analysis
This Python project provides a comprehensive analysis of cost of living data across various countries. It leverages the power of Seaborn for data visualization, offering insightful bar charts, heatmaps, and pairplots to explore cost variations.

## Key Functionalities:

-Data Acquisition: Reads cost of living data from a CSV file.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides an initial overview of the data to understand its structure and characteristics.

-Cost of Living Comparisons: Identifies the top 10 most expensive and cheapest countries for overall living costs, rent, groceries, restaurant prices, and local purchasing power.

## Seaborn Visualizations: 
Creates informative visualizations including:

-Bar charts for comparing top/bottom countries across various cost factors.

-Heatmap to depict correlations between cost of living indexes.

-Pairplot to explore relationships between different cost variables.
